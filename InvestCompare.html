<div id='KJECalculatorDescID'>How taxes are applied to an investment can make an incredible difference. This calculator is designed to help compare a normal taxable investment with two common tax-advantaged situations: an investment in which taxes are deferred until withdrawals are made, and an investment in which taxes are paid on money that goes into the account, but all withdrawals are tax-free.</div>
